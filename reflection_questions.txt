* Design
- What is your research about?
- What type of pipeline do you expect to use?
- What is the social and historical context of the inequality of social issues your work might affect?
- What are you planning to do to make sure you have inclusive data?
- Why are you doing this research?
- How do you personally benefit from doing this research?
- If this research is not done carefully, who might it harm?
- What is the worst thing that could happen to someone because of this
  model?


* Data collection
- What characteristics does this data set include? (Checklist with race, ethnicity, gender, etc.)
- How are your features relevant to the question you're trying to answer
- Why does the data set include these characteristics? Why does it not include others? How might this affect your conclusions?
- Think about the intersectional identities that are most represented. Who is being centered in the data? Why? How might this affect your analysis?
- Think about the intersectional identities that are least represented or not represented at all. Who is being marginalized in the data? Why? How might this affect your analysis?


* Explore
- Are you using proxies for characteristics you don't have direct data on? How could those proxies be discriminatory against people with some of the intersectional identities in the data?
- What are known relationships from previous literature about the
  relationship between feature A and [a possible value of race,
  gender, or something else]
  
  
* Model
- Ask for accuracy of model on each intersectional identity
- Who is included? Who is excluded? Why? How?


* Interpret
- Is this model applicable on the scale you expect it to be used? (See
  WMD 30)
- What is a safe scale for this model? (See WMD 30)
- How popular do you think this model will become? Why? (WMD 31)
