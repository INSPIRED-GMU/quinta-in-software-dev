* Design
- What is your research about?
- What type of pipeline do you expect to use?
- What is the social and historical context of the inequality of social issues your work might affect?
- What are you planning to do to make sure you have inclusive data?
- Why are you doing this research?
- How do you personally benefit from doing this research?
- If this research is not done carefully, who might it harm?


* Data collection
- What characteristics does this data set include? (Checklist with race, ethnicity, gender, etc.)
- Why does the data set include these characteristics? Why does it not include others? How might this affect your conclusions?
- Think about the intersectional identities that are most represented. Who is being centered in the data? Why? How might this affect your analysis?
- Think about the intersectional identities that are least represented or not represented at all. Who is being marginalized in the data? Why? How might this affect your analysis?


* Explore
- Are you using proxies for characteristics you don't have direct data on? How could those proxies be discriminatory against people with some of the intersectional identities in the data?

* Model
- Ask for accuracy of model on each intersectional identity
- Who is included? Who is excluded? Why? How?
