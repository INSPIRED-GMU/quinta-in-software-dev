# quinta-in-software-dev
A workflow support tool to help data scientists and software developers use the Quantitative Intersectional Data (QUINTA) framework


Quintessence, a novel prototype tool that supports reflexive intersectionality in data-centric processes. Quintessence was inspired by 
existing work in intersectional quantitative data analysis that suggests intersectionality and reflexivity play central roles in recognizing and 
addressing technological inequalities. The main components of Quintessence are critical reflection questions that encourage reflexivity 
at each stage of the data science process and analytic support for exploring intersectionality in and across data sets. Analytic support for 
Quintessence is provided by QuinterPy, a Python library that includes functionality for intersectional representation analysis (InRA) 
and comparative intersectional representation analysis (CInRA), both of which are useful and applicable outside the context of Quintessence.
